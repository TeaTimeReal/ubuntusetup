# Ubuntu Setup Script

### Simple bash script that runs updates, installs some basic utilities and configures a few things:
1. **docker**
2. **node** Version 18.17.1, *npm* and *n*(node version manager)
3. **net-tools** to use ifconfig
4. Enable firewall and allow 22/ssh (Uses ufw doesn't install it however)
5. **VSCode** (Uses snap doesn't istall it however)
6. **Oracle Virtual Box Guest Additions** - Nice to have if running in a VM using VirtualBox. Guest additions need to be inserted beforehand via ISO.
